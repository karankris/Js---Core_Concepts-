//JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 and first js engine was SpiderMonkey
// astexplorer.net converts js code into abstract syntax tree (Refer image 1.6 for sample AST tree)
// Js engine uses compilent and interpretted so it is is called as JIT (Just in time) compilent language.
// (AOT) Ahead of time compiler takes a code wich will later executed and then optimize the code
// V8 engine architecture refer image 1.7
